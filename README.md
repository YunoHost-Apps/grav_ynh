## Documentation

 * Official documentation: https://learn.getgrav.org/17/
 * YunoHost documentation: If specific documentation is needed, feel free to contribute.

## Limitations

* If installing Grav at the root of a domain, bear in mind that paths starting by `/yunohost` are reserved.

## Installation

Use either YunoHost's admin panel or command line:

```sh
sudo yunohost app install https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/grav_ynh
```

For upgrading (replace `grav` by the actual instance ID if more instances are installed):
```sh
sudo yunohost app upgrade grav -u https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/grav_ynh
```

## Administration and plugin installation

* You can access the administration panel at `yourdomain.tld/path/admin`. Users created within YunoHost can log in, provided their were given the appropriate permissions (see next section).
* Grav provides a command line interface. Refer to its documentation, but you will need to specifically call for the PHP version currently used for the app:
  * Go to your app's directory: `cd /var/www/grav` (or `grav__2`, etc. if you have multiple ones)
  * `php7.3 bin/grav ...` or `php7.3 bin/gpm ...` 
* You can install plugins through the admin panel, or through the GPM.

## Permissions

To make users administrators, give them the `grav.admin` permission.
To allow users to log in, give them the `grav.user` permission.
