Before v1.7.45~ynh3 of this package, an upstream quirk made the app generate a backup daily, despite the default configuration suggesting it to be disabled.

Starting this version, if you had not already altered the Scheduler configuration, this is fixed.

The backups directory is also not backed up by YunoHost anymore, as it was superfluous.
